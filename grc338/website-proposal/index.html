					<h1>About Us</h1>

					<p>    With life having transitioned to being at home most of the time, our founders longed to bring a little bit of the outdoors into their home. At first, the idea of successfully taking care of a plant seemed intimidating and difficult. However, after finding a low-maintenance and easy plant to take care of, our founders developed a passion for plants. This led our founders to create The Greenery to encourage people to bring a little green into their home by offering a variety of plants that cater to beginners or experts.   </p>
